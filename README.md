# Diff Trek

A fast desktop Git diff viewer. Every changed file appears in **one continuous
scrolling document**, and Previous/Next Change step through every hunk in the
entire working-tree diff — crossing file boundaries without the reader having
to think about them.

That last part is the point. Traditional diff tools scope next/previous-change
navigation to the file you happen to have open; Diff Trek does not.

*Usage documentation and binaries*: https://citricity.github.io/difftrek/

## Requirements

- Node 20.19+, 22.13+ or 24+, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- Rust (stable) and the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform
- Git on your `PATH`

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev          # desktop app against the current repository
```

`pnpm dev` alone runs the UI in a browser against sample data, which is handy
for working on the interface without the desktop shell.
Add `?landing` to the address (`http://localhost:1420/?landing`) to see the
screen shown outside a repository instead, with any extensions' panels on it.
Those panels' own commands have no sample data, so they answer with an error.

Passing `--example` shows that same sample diff in the desktop app instead of
reading a repository, so it opens anywhere — no Git working tree required:

```bash
difftrek --example
pnpm tauri dev -- -- --example   # the same, during development
```

The sample is several files, one of them with two hunks, plus a binary file and
a deleted one — enough to try continuous scrolling and global Previous/Next
Change against. The repository name reads `difftrek (example)` so it is never
mistaken for real changes.

To set up `git dt`, open Diff Trek and choose **Diff Trek > Install 'git dt'
Command…** (macOS). It shows the exact `git config --global` command it will run,
and any `dt` alias it would replace, before running anything. It points the
alias at the copy of Diff Trek you opened, and warns if that copy is somewhere
temporary — a disk image, macOS app translocation, or a debug build.

From a terminal, or on platforms without the menu, the script does the same:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
./scripts/install-git-alias.sh
```

`git dt` then opens Diff Trek on whichever repository you are standing in. The
alias resolves the repository root itself and passes it as an argument, because
a macOS `.app` bundle does not inherit the shell's working directory. On macOS
it launches the bundle with `open -n` rather than running its executable, because
macOS will not give focus to an app the terminal started directly — its window
would open behind the terminal. Anything
after `git dt` is passed on too, so it can open a commit or a range instead:

```bash
git dt                  # unstaged changes
git dt HEAD~1           # one commit's own changes (also abc123^!)
git dt main...HEAD      # what this branch changed since it left main
git dt v1.0..v2.0       # straight comparison of two commits
git dt main feature     # the same, as two arguments
```

An omitted side of a range is `HEAD` (`git dt main...`). A single commit is
compared with its first parent, like `git show`; a root commit with nothing.
Without the alias the revision goes after the repository path:
`diff-trek /path/to/repo main...HEAD`.

An alias installed by an earlier version may not pass arguments on, or may open
the window behind the terminal; install it again to pick up both.

However many times you run it, there is one Diff Trek, with a window per
review, so macOS shows one Dock icon and its right-click menu (like the Window
menu) lists the windows by repository, with the folder it is in, and by branch
or range. Running `git dt`
again for a repository and range that already has a window brings that window
to the front and reloads it; anything else opens a new one. On macOS,
**File > New Window** (⌘N) opens an empty window, for comparing something
else beside what is already open; elsewhere, starting Diff Trek again outside
a repository does the same. Closing the last window quits.

## What it shows

Given a commit or range, Diff Trek shows the diff between those two commits,
read entirely from Git's objects — the index and working tree play no part.

Otherwise it reviews **unstaged changes to tracked files** — exactly what a bare
`git diff` reports, the index compared against the working tree. So:

- staged changes are excluded; if a file is partly staged you see only the
  unstaged remainder
- untracked files never appear (a v2 feature)
- modified, deleted, renamed and type-changed tracked files all show up

## Settings

**Diff Trek → Settings…** (⌘,) on macOS, or the gear in the toolbar. They live
in `settings.json` in the platform's
own config directory, written through the backend rather than kept in the
webview, and a missing or damaged file reads as the defaults rather than as an
error — a preference is never worth an error screen in front of the diff.

The macOS menu bar has the same shape as Tauri's own default — ⌘C, ⌘W, Hide
and About behave as the OS defines them — but Diff Trek builds it itself
(`src-tauri/src/menu.rs`) so that every label is in the interface's language.
The Settings item and the three zoom items in View are additions, because
those are what `PredefinedMenuItem` cannot supply: the OS knows what About and
Quit do, but only the app knows what Settings opens or what the next zoom
level is. Other platforms get no menu from Tauri, so there the gear is the way
in and the zoom keys stand alone.

The item follows macOS 13, which renamed Preferences to Settings; the dialog,
the Rust module and `settings.json` all use the same word.

Deliberately small: `CLAUDE.md` puts complex preference screens out of scope.

## Languages

Diff Trek speaks English (UK and US), German, French and Spanish. **Settings →
Language** is Automatic by default, which follows the languages the operating
system lists, in order, and falls back to British English; choosing a language
there overrides it. The change is immediate, the menu bar included.

The words live in one place, `locales/<tag>.json`, which both halves read: the
React side imports them through Vite, and the Rust side embeds the same files
with `include_str!` (`crates/extension-api/src/i18n.rs`), so the menu, error
messages from the backend and the interface can never disagree. Each file is a
flat map from a key to a message; `{name}` is a placeholder, and an object of
`one`/`other` forms is a plural, chosen by the `count` argument with the
language's own rules. `en-GB` is the base and is complete; any other language
must be complete too, except a regional variant of the base (`en-US`), which
holds only what differs. Tests in both languages check every catalogue against
the base, keys and placeholders alike.

To add a language: add `locales/<tag>.json`, list it in `CORE` in
`crates/extension-api/src/i18n.rs` and in `src-tauri/Info.plist` (tests catch
either being missed), and give it a `language.name` in itself.

The output of `git dt --createchangelog` and the changelog format stay in
English on purpose: they are read by agents and parsed by the app.

## Keyboard

| Key         | Action              |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| `n` / `j`   | Next change         |
| `p` / `k`   | Previous change     |
| `⌘+` / `⌘-` | Larger / smaller    |
| `⌘0`        | Back to actual size |

In the file list: type to filter, `↑` / `↓` to move, `Enter` to go, `Esc` to
close.

Zoom is `Ctrl` rather than `⌘` off macOS, and scales everything — the code, the
chrome, the icons and the borders — because it is the webview's own page zoom
rather than a font size. That also leaves the CSS pixel the row model is built
on alone, so the renderer never learns it happened. The level is a setting, so
a window opens at the size you left it.

## Architecture

```
React
  ↓
useRepositoryDiff / useDiffNavigation      hooks own loading and navigation
  ↓
services/backend.ts                        the only module that calls invoke()
  ↓
Tauri command
  ↓
src-tauri/src/git/                         git execution, parsing, domain logic
```

Three things are kept deliberately separate, and conflating them is the bug
this design exists to prevent:

| Concept                    | Where it lives                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Files in the diff          | `state.files` — the complete list    |
| Files whose diff is loaded | `DocumentFile.diff !== null`         |
| Files currently rendered   | `visibleRange()` in the virtualiser  |

A repository might have 300 changed files, 80 loaded diffs and 6 rows on
screen. Global navigation still behaves as though the whole repository is one
logical document, because it resolves against the model (`lib/navigation.ts`)
and never against the DOM.

### Rendering

The diff renderer is Diff Trek's own (`features/diff/`), roughly 250 lines
over a handful of components. Every row has a known height — a diff line is
exactly one line tall — so scroll offsets are exact arithmetic rather than
estimates, and revealing a hunk needs no measurement pass.

The geometry is read at runtime from the CSS custom properties in
`styles/tokens.css`, so changing a row height or the code font size is a
one-line change with no matching edit in TypeScript.

By default lines do not wrap: long ones scroll horizontally while the
line-number gutter stays pinned. Settings can wrap them at the edge of the
window or at a fixed column instead — see below.

### Syntax colours

Code is coloured by [Shiki](https://shiki.style), using the same TextMate
grammars VS Code does. Grammars load on demand, one chunk per language, so a
session only fetches what it looked at.

The colours are not Shiki's. `lib/syntaxTheme.ts` maps every scope to a CSS
custom property, and `styles/tokens.css` defines them — values modelled on
VS Code's default Light+ and Dark+, sitting alongside the existing diff greens
and reds. So the palette is retuned in CSS, switches with `prefers-color-scheme`
without re-tokenising anything, and stays part of Diff Trek's own small design
system rather than a bundled editor theme.

Three details do the real work:

- Each side is tokenised as the **whole file** it is, not as the hunks it was
  cut into. A hunk that opens inside a block comment has no way to know that
  from its own text, and would colour the comment as code.
- The old and new sides are tokenised **separately**. Interleaved `-`/`+` lines
  are not a program either, and highlighting them as one text lets an
  unterminated string on a deleted line bleed into the line that replaced it.
- Syntax colour and word-level change shading are merged into one flat list of
  spans per line (`lib/runs.ts`) rather than nested. Their boundaries do not
  line up — a changed word can span several tokens, and one token can be
  partly changed — so neither can wrap the other.

Highlighting happens while a diff loads, before it is shown, which keeps the
render path synchronous. It is strictly a nicety: a missing grammar, an
unrecognised extension or a tokeniser failure all end with the diff rendering
uncoloured rather than not at all.

### Wrapping

Wrapping is off by default. Settings offers two ways to turn it on:

- **At window edge** (`auto`) wraps each line where it meets the edge of the
  viewport — of one pane, in the split view — and rewraps as the window is
  resized.
- **At fixed column** (`column`) wraps at a chosen column whatever the window
  size. The column is stored separately from the mode, so choosing another
  mode and coming back does not forget it.

Settings files from before `auto` existed stored `"wrap": true`; that still
reads, as a fixed column.

Diff Trek does the wrapping itself rather than handing it to CSS, and the
reason is the scroll model. `white-space: pre-wrap` breaks at word boundaries
where it can, so the number of visual lines depends on where the spaces fall
and only the DOM would know it — which is exactly the measurement the
virtualiser exists to avoid. Wrapping at a fixed column keeps it arithmetic: a
line is `ceil(length / column)` rows tall, and `lib/wrap.ts` splits its spans to
match, preserving colour and change shading across the break.

Auto wrapping is the same arithmetic with the column worked out rather than
chosen. The code font is monospaced, so the column is the line's width, less
the gutter and trailing padding, divided by one character's measured width
(`autoWrapColumn` in `lib/rows.ts`), less one column of slack for wide glyphs.
It never drops below 20; a narrower window scrolls rather than wrapping every
line into fragments.

Resizing therefore rebuilds the row model, which is the one expensive thing a
drag can trigger, so it is kept in check twice over. The width that drives it
is throttled to one update per 100 ms, with a trailing update so the size a
drag ends on is always the one laid out (`lib/throttle.ts`); and the model is
memoised on the whole-number column, so most of those updates change nothing.
The viewport's own size is not throttled — the virtualiser needs it live, and
it is cheap. When the column does change, the row at the top of the viewport
is found in the new model and put back at the top before paint, so the text
being read stays put while every wrapped line above it changes height.
A continuation row carries no line number on either side. That is unambiguous
on its own — every real diff line has at least one, an addition lacking only the
old number and a deletion only the new — but it is quiet, so continuations also
show a faint `↪` where the `+`/`-` marker would be.

### Split view

The toolbar toggles between one interleaved column and two panes, original on
the left and working copy on the right. Settings holds the mode a window
*opens* with; the toolbar changes the window you are in, and a preference
arriving late never snatches back a choice already made.

Each pane is the unified view in miniature — its own pinned gutter, the same
wrapping, the same colours — and a row is as tall as its taller side, so the
two keep a common baseline when one wraps and the other does not.

Which deletion faces which addition is not something Git says; it only says
what went and what came. `lib/pairing.ts` pairs them positionally within a
changed block, first against first, with the remainder facing blanks — a blank
being drawn as *absent* rather than empty, since an empty line is a real line
with no text on it.

The panes clip and translate rather than scroll. One scroller across two
columns would walk you off the end of the left pane and into the right instead
of holding both at the same column, so the horizontal offset is state, shared
between the panes, driven by trackpad gestures, shift-wheel, and a scrollbar of
the view's own.

### Expanding context

The lines between two hunks are not gone, just not shown. Each gap carries an
expander: one click reveals twenty lines towards the change on that side, or
the whole gap once twenty lines or fewer remain. Expanding the middle of a gap
leaves an expander either side of the new context, so repeated clicks converge
on the whole file.

Expanded context does not join the Previous/Next Change sequence. It is
context, not a change.

This and whole-file highlighting share one source. Both sides of a file are
read via `get_file_contents` alongside its diff — lazily, like the diff itself,
so the cost tracks what you scroll to rather than the size of the repository —
and then **every diff line is checked against the file it claims to come
from**. A single disagreement, which is what a working tree edited mid-review
looks like, withdraws the file from both features rather than showing
surrounding lines that are quietly wrong.

### Going to a file

Changes are the main way through a review; files are a way to skip ahead. The
sticky file header at the top of the document names the file you are in, and
clicking its path drops down a list of every changed file, opened on that one.
Type to filter — fuzzily, so `dd` finds `DiffDocument.tsx` — then use the
arrows and Enter, or click.

Choosing a file lands on its **first change**, so Next and Previous carry on
from there, loading the file first if it has not been read. A collapsed file
lands on its header instead. Filtering ranks consecutive characters, word
starts and the file name above scattered matches in the directory
(`lib/fileFilter.ts`).

The document ends with space to spare — at least a viewport's worth, and a
short message from the mascot — so that a change in the last file can still be
scrolled up to sit under the sticky header. Without it, jumping near the end
stopped short and the header went on naming the file above.

A persistent sidebar was considered and passed over: it would cost width all
the time, which the split view and wrapping at the window edge need most, and
opening the list on the current file gives most of what a sidebar that follows
you would.

### Images

A changed image is shown rather than reported as a binary file: before on the
left, after on the right, each scaled down to fit a row of fixed height
(`--image-row-height`) and never scaled up. An added image has nothing before it
and a deleted one nothing after. PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, ICO and AVIF are
shown; SVG is not on the list because Git diffs it as text.

The bytes come from `get_image_bytes`, returned as a raw binary IPC body rather
than JSON. It reads only image files, and declines anything over 20 MB. Each
side is fetched when its row first comes into view and cached against the diff.

### Lazy loading

```
1. Discover changed files          (two cheap git calls, no diff bodies)
2. Render the document skeleton    (header and file list appear immediately)
3. Load the first few diffs
4. Load neighbours as they approach the viewport
```

At most five diffs are read concurrently. Diffs above 2 MB come back marked
`truncated` and are rendered as a "Load anyway" notice rather than stalling
startup; that cap is also what bounds the size of the row model.

## Development

```bash
pnpm check             # typecheck, lint, frontend tests, Rust tests
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm test:rust
pnpm test:integration  # needs a browser; see below
pnpm format
```

### The integration suite

`tests/integration/` builds the app, serves it, and drives a real browser
against the built-in sample. It is not part of `pnpm check` because it needs a
browser binary that a fresh clone does not have:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
pnpm test:integration
```

It exists because the unit tests run under jsdom, which has no layout engine —
every element is zero by zero there, so a bug that makes the document zero
pixels wide is invisible to it. One did exactly that: `useElementSize` measured
nothing and reported zero forever, and two fallbacks hid it until the split view
came to depend on the width alone. These assertions fail on that bug and pass
without it, which was checked by putting it back.

`DIFFTREK_CHROMIUM` overrides the browser path, for images that ship their own
Chromium rather than Playwright's.

### The application icon

`app-icon.png` at the repository root is the source: 1024×1024, transparent
outside the rounded rectangle, no baked-in shadow. `src-tauri/icons/` is
generated from it.

`app-icon-small.png` is the same drawing with four of the seven bars removed.
Below about 48px seven bars stop being shapes and become texture, so the
small entries — `32x32.png`, and the 16, 32 and 48 entries inside `icon.ico`
and `icon.icns` — come from that one instead. The geometry is identical; only
the bar count differs.

One thing to know before regenerating with `pnpm tauri icon app-icon.png`:
`icon.icns` is **not** full-bleed. macOS draws its own shadow and expects the
rounded rectangle to sit inside a margin — 824 of 1024, as Apple's own icons do
— or it stands a head taller than everything else in the Dock. Every other size
is full-bleed. `tauri icon` does not know about that margin and will flatten it.

Tests concentrate on behaviour with real value: global navigation order,
flattening files and hunks into that order, the row/offset arithmetic, word
diffing, error mapping, and — on the Rust side — unified diff parsing plus
integration tests that build actual repositories and assert the staged versus
unstaged semantics.

## Out of scope

Diff Trek is a diff viewer, not a Git GUI. No staging, committing, editing,
history browsing, branch management or remote integration.
