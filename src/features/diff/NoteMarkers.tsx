/**
 * What the AI changelog has to say, drawn in the gutter.
 *
 * The markers sit left of the line numbers, inside the gutter, so the gutter's
 * opaque background covers them and they stay put when a long line is scrolled
 * sideways. Everything here is an icon in a row that already exists: no row
 * changes height, which is what the whole scroll model rests on.
 *
 * Each row renders the `.notes` column itself, empty or not, so the line
 * numbers stay in one column down the document. These components fill it.
